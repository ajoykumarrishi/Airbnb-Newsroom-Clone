# Overview
This project is a clone of the April 2024 Airbnb Newsroom website, created with the intention of gaining a deeper understanding of Bootstrap 4. The clone aims to replicate the layout, design, and functionality of the original website, while utilizing Bootstrap 4 for responsive and mobile-friendly web development. It is NOT pixel-perfect and intentionally so!

## Features
- Utilization of Bootstrap 4 for grid layout, responsive design, and UI components.
- Responsive design ensuring optimal viewing experience across various devices and screen sizes.
- CSS customization to match the visual styling of the original website.
- Interactive elements and animations to enhance user experience.
